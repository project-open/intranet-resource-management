  <msg key="Percentage_Report_Help">&lt;h2&gt;Resource Management Report - By Percentage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resource management report shows summarized assignments of natural persons by task,
project, user and department, aggregated from the actual to a task up the project hierarchy 
towards the user and department level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Effective Working Time&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
    The values shown in this report refer to percentages of the effective working time
    of resources.
    This time can be set in the &#39;Employee Information&#39; portlet on the user&#39;s page. &lt;br&gt;
    Example: Assigning a user working a 50% part-time job to a task with 80% will 
    result in a 40% assignment.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assignment Duration and Precision&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
    The duration of an assignment includes both the start and end date of the task.
    Assignments are currently only per days. Future versions of this report
    will allow for assignments per hour and minute based on a calendar with
    working hours.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vacation and other absences&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
    Vacation and other absences may already be included in the project planning or not.
    This report doesn&#39;t know about this, so the user needs to set the &#39;Count Absences?&#39;
    switch accordingly. The default is to count absences, assuming the project manager
    doesn&#39;t know about the user&#39;s vacations etc.&lt;br&gt;
    Example: A user is assigned with 100% to a task, while he is going to have vacation.
    With &#39;Count Absences?&#39; checked, the report will shows an overallocation during this 
    time.
